## Introduction

This repository provides an overview of several important ES6 features. These features help make JavaScript code more concise, readable, and easier to maintain. 

## Concepts Covered

### Arrow Functions

Arrow functions provide a shorter syntax for writing function expressions and lexically bind the `this` value.

### Ternary Operator

The ternary operator is a shorthand for the `if-else` statement, allowing for concise conditional expressions.

### Spread and Rest Operators

The spread operator (`...`) allows an iterable to be expanded in places where zero or more arguments are expected. The rest operator (`...`) allows you to represent an indefinite number of arguments as an array.

### Function Default Parameters

Function default parameters allow you to initialize named parameters with default values if no value or `undefined` is passed.

### Destructuring

Destructuring assignment allows you to unpack values from arrays or properties from objects into distinct variables.

### Template Literals

Template literals provide a way to embed expressions within string literals, allowing for multi-line strings and string interpolation.
