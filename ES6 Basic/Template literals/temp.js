//  What is template literals???

// Template literals are just like quotation mark that are used to show output statements and values of variables
// Sign that are used to display template literals are: ` `

// Let me explain this topic with the help of example

let name = "Abdul Munnam"

console.log(`My name is ${name}`);    // Output: My name is Abdul Munnam

// here I'm sure you will confused at ${} ? if yes let me explain
// ${} is often used in template literals or backets, basically it is used to show the value of the output



// This was all about template literals or backets
